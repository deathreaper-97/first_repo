# first_repo
Howdy, this is my first repo where I am initially storing my first few coding assingments. This will help showcase my skills. 
I am still getting acquainted with git and github and in time I will master these along with becoming an adept programmer.
Programming is like writing, in that, you are trying to solve a high level problem and break it down into simpler statements.
A programming statement is like a sentence in a story. The end, for now.
